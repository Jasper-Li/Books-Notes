While I am reading man page of getline, I confuse with some concepts of the Example. 

###1. size_t and ssize_t

	typedef long unsigned int size_t;
	typedef long int __ssize_t;
	typedef __ssize_t ssize_t;

###2. printf %zu
	z: A following integer conversion corresponds to a size_t or ssize_t argument.
	u: The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal.
